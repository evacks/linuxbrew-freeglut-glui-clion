# linuxbrew-freeglut-glui-clion
A scratchpad-like repository on setting up CLion with homebrew stuff on linux for my future self

## Installation
1. Install homebrew
2. Install g++ cmake glui and freeglut via Homebrew
3. Get CLion going
4. Modify CMakeTXT using that template
5. Set up CLion to point to the homebrew-installed cmake and g++
